# MFC.student_project2015
# this project finished at 2015 when i was a student, 
# so this program has a lot bug, please forgive me, i'm not going to fixed this shit;
# here's the problem:
#   1.i need to find back some shared link library for windows, then i can run this program;
#     i had find all the shared link library this program needed already, just run it, it will works;
#
#   2.this program has two version, i dont remember the details, 
#     but SyncMultiSocket-TestFramework is working good, so use it;
#
#   3.windows MFC window, handle window's message limit once 4500 times, 
#     so if i input more test times, then this program will crash!! and that's so embarrassed me;
#
#   4.new bug:
#     when i test this program for a few times, then i found another problem:
#     test this program a few times, then the main program has crashed, also so embarrassed me;
#     (shit program, this is the student's work from me? i can't believe this bullshit happened to me)
#
# anyway, i was so happy today, finally i fount my old school time codes, LOL;
# after this program, i never touch windows system again, 
# i gived up everything from windows system, then turn ahead to linux system from 0;
# from 0!! i need to learn linux system begin at how to install linux system on PC;
# my first linux system is ubuntu, but only use ubuntu for one months, then i changed my desktop system to debian-linux;
# i love debian, easy and fast and safety, giving me a lot good memories, and FreeBSD also gived me a lot helps, thanks a lot;
